# Spartan Protocol Documentation Repo

## Temporary repo (WIP)
This documentation repo is a WIP, if you aren't contributing and only looking for the current useable docs, please visit here:
https://docs.spartanprotocol.org

This repo will eventually replace that implementation so that the documentation is more transparent and located where the rest of the community code is (GitHub)

If you would like to help contribute to this WIP docs repo, please check the 'Issues' tab for any current progress etc and then proceed with the following to get started:

## Local preview/dev
`yarn docsify serve docs`

## Edit/contribute to the docs
- Reach out in the issues tab or telegram (or anywhere really) and ask to be added as a contributor so you dont have to fork the code to contribute (or just proceed & get added after, up to you)
- Go to `./docs` folder
- Find the page you want to edit
- Edit it using markdown formatting https://www.markdownguide.org/
- Save and make a PR
