## Donations

As you no doubt have read by now, Spartan Protocol is a community built, run and maintained project with no funding or treasury. Every protocol, DApp, blog, website, DEX tool etc that has been built within the Spartan ecosystem was funded by the individuals who were doing the building or the community looking on.

The Certik audit was crowdfunded inside the community channel within a few days, the CodeArena contest was funded by a combination of gas reimbursements, Telegram crowdfunding, DApp donations, anonymous donations and as payment from work community members performed on other projects. When there is a will, Spartans find a way.
