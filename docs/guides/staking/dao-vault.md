## Staking your LP Tokens into the DAO Vault

Similar to many other protocols, emissions yield is granted to users who lock/stake their Liquidity Pool tokens.
Spartan Protocol allows users to stake their Liquidity Pool tokens, such as BNBp or BUSDp, into the Vault, which can be accessed via the nav menu.

![Nav menu](/../../_media/guides/staking/dao-menu.png)

In preparation for staking, you will need to have some Liquidity Pool tokens, which can be obtained by [adding liquidity](/guides/liquidity/add-both). Only [Curated Pools](/liquidity-pools?id=curated-pools) are eligible for emissions yield.

## DAO Vault Details

![Details](/../../_media/guides/staking/dao-details.png)

In this screen, Spartans can see the total amount of SPARTA that is currently locked into the DAO. This is the SPARTA attributable to the staked Liquidity Pool Tokens. Referred to as the 'Total Weight', or 100% of the voting power for any DAO proposals that may be raised.

When staking in the DAO Vault, your LP tokens (and any others of the same type already in the vault) will be locked for 24 hours. During this time period, you will not be able to withdraw your LP tokens from the vault.

The historical APY of the DaoVault is also shown here. This should be used as a guide only and is the APY earned by the vault over the past 30 days.

## Member Details

Here, we see the user's total weight locked in the DaoVault, calculated in SPARTA. Also shown is the percentage of the total vault weight your wallet represents. You will also see, based on your weight and a bunch of other dynamic variables, how much of the emissions yield SPARTA can be harvested right now. Underneath that we have your last harvest time.

- Emissions yield is calculated dynamically
- This can be harvested at any time & is not necessarily 'accumulative' as it uses variables that are affected by other users when they add/remove weight or harvest SPARTA
- There are variables that could make your harvestable amount actually go down or up based on what you may have seen earlier
- Whilst the 'ideal' time to harvest is subjective and different person to person, ideally, you should be harvesting at least once per month. Some users harvest more often, like daily for instance.
- You should assess the value of your harvest against the costs (gas) and convenience to find a suitable schedule that works for you to come check the DAO proposals and claim your regular harvest

#### How to Harvest

- To harvest, simply click 'Harvest All' and confirm the prompts in your wallet
- You will need to have some BNB in your wallet to cover the gas costs

## Vault Item Details

![Item Details](/../../_media/guides/staking/dao-item.png)

The items that precede the 'member' tile are each 'Curated' pool or if you previously deposited a no-longer-curated pool it will show up here also. You can see:

- **'Balance'** of the respective LP tokens held in your wallet

- Confirm the 24hr lockout (The LP tokens being deposited & any of the same type already in the DaoVault will be locked in the DaoVault for 24 hours; cannot be withdrawn)
- If you have not harvested recently; there will be another confirmation here to 'confirm harvest time reset' which means you know that your available harvest will be reset to zero & you will not receive any harvest rewards!
