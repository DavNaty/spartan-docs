## Claiming your Bonded LPs

Spartan Protocol allowed users to Bond an asset with SPARTA, such as BNB or BTCB, into the BondVault, which can be accessed via the nav menu.

If you ever successfully completed a Bond during the distribution phase, your Bonded LP tokens will automatically go to the BondVault which we will talk about below.

## Bond Vault Details

In this screen, Spartans will be able to see details about the BondVault variables and weights. Currently, there is not much info here, but there is a link to these very Docs for more info.

## Vault Item Details

![Item](/../../_media/guides/staking/bond-item.png)

The items that precede the 'details' tile are each Bondable asset, or if you previously Bonded a no-longer-Bond-listed token it should show up here also. You can see:

- **'Remaining'** of the respective LP tokens staked in the BondVault for you
- **'Claimable'** represents the amount of LP tokens that are available for you to remove from the vault right now
- **'Last Claim'** is the time when you last claimed these LP tokens from the BondVault
- **'Final Date'** is an estimate of the date when you will be able to claim the entire remaining BondVault position

#### How to Claim 'Unlocked' Bond LP Tokens

- Each BondVault item is handled as its own sub-item for you to claim an individual Bonded LP position.
- Look for the BondVault item that you want to claim
- To claim, simply click 'Claim' and confirm the prompts in your wallet
- You will need to have some BNB in your wallet to cover the gas costs
- The claimable LP tokens will be sent directly from the BondVault to your wallet, you are welcome to then deposit them in the DaoVault if you wish (or leave them in the BondVault for essentially the same benefits with Harvesting & DAO proposal weight)
