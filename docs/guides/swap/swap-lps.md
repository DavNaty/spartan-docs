## Swap LP Tokens

Before you begin, make sure you have already created your wallet and connected it to the DApp. This guide assumes you have done the necessary steps to get setup including doing research on how these functions work. [We also have some extended information on 'swapping' here.](/swap.md)

#### 1. Swap page in the DApp

Visit the community DApp swap page: [https://dapp.spartanprotocol.org/swap](https://dapp.spartanprotocol.org/swap)

Or navigate to the swap page if you are already in the DApp:  
![Menu liquidity](/../../_media/guides/swap/nav-menu-swap.png)

- Open the menu
- Click 'Swap'

This can also be acheived via the 'pools' / 'home' page by clicking 'Swap' under the specific asset you want to swap:

#### 2. Select your LP token to sell

- Select which LP token you want to sell
- The purpose of this guide is for swapping *LP tokens*, not normal tokens, so we will be selecting the 'LP Tokens' tab to filter the choices down to only relevant tokens

---

#### 3. Select an LP token to receive

- Again; the purpose of this guide is for swapping *LP* tokens, not normal tokens, so if you selected an LP token in the previous step, you will find the list of selectable assets are now already filtered to other LP tokens
- With that said, you can now go ahead and select which pool you want to transfer your value over to

---

#### 4. Input an amount

- Input the amount of the LP tokens you would like to sell
- The estimated output amount of the other LP token will be calculated for you
- Remember that this is just an estimate; the pool ratios can change between what you see and the end result so be very careful to ensure both pools are deep and stable before continuing
- You may click the 'MAX' button next to your balance to use the full amount, but be careful of slippage (always check the rate to make sure you aren't doing a bad trade)

---

#### 5. Confirm Everything Before Continuing

- Confirm you have inputted and selected everything correctly
- You will see a 'Rate' row. This is the estimated swap rate that you are getting with this swap. You can click the 'arrows' to the right of this row to flip the rate over to the other token

![Confirm rate](/../../_media/guides/swap/confirmlp1.png)

- Below that is the 'Slip' row. This represents the percentage difference between the 'Spot' rate and the 'Swap' rate. One can consider this to be fairly comparable to the trading term: 'Spread' 
- It is advisable to pay particular attention to this value not being too high when swapping LPs, as this is probably your best indicator of whether you are getting a bad rate or not (there is no outside market to compare an LP token's value/rate against)

![Confirm slip](/../../_media/guides/swap/confirmlp2.png)

- Then we have the magical 'Revenue' row. This estimates the total revenue being generated by this transaction and being injected into the pool to be attributed directly to our liquidity providers

- The last informational row is the 'Output' estimate. This is the amount that is estimated for you to receive

#### 6. First-Time Approval

- If this is the first time interacting with the relevant underlying contract (or if the contracts have been upgraded recently) you will need to perform some token approvals before performing the actual transaction
- Approvals/Allowance changing is a standard ERC20 (or BEP20 in this instance) token contract feature that helps prevent accidentally interacting with bogus contracts; you should always confirm the contract you are interacting with is the correct one in a DApp
- It involves a simple on-chain txn that allows your wallet to send a specific amount of a specific token to a specific contract. The contract in this instance is the Spartan Protocol ROUTER contract which handles the routing of funds from the user to the pools and back again
- Click approve and confirm each on your wallet once you have verified this is correct

#### 7. Perform Swap

- After approval, the button for the actual transaction should now be visible
- This is a good time to do a final check and verify all the inputs look correct
- Click the 'Sell' button and confirm the transaction in your wallet

![Add both txn](/../../_media/guides/swap/sell-lp.png)

#### 8. Verify Result

- Congratulations; you just swapped migrated your LP token's from one pool to another! Pretty cool...
- Once the transaction completes, feel free to click the wallet icon (top right of DApp) and click the 'LPs' tab to see your fresh LP tokens in your wallet

#### 9. Troubleshooting

- If after 'approval' the red button shows up but is disabled or has a different label, please see these reasons:
  - **Check Wallet:** You have not yet connected your wallet to the DApp, follow this guide.
  - **Check Input:** One of your input amounts are not valid; it might be 0 or a negative number. Confirm and fix.
  - **Check BNB (Gas):** You do not have enough BNB in your wallet to cover the chain gas costs of this txn. Transfer some BNB into your wallet to continue. Also, confirm you have the intended wallet connected.
  - **Check Balance:** The input amount is higher than the balance in your wallet; go back to step 5 and also confirm you have the intended wallet connected.
  - **Pool Frozen:** The Curated pool you are trying to move liquidity from is currently outside its safe rates. You will need to wait for the pools to rebalance or for the safe ratio to adjust to a safe level.
  - **Slip Too High:** This is a feature to protect you from performing a liquidity-add with very high slippage. Check the pool depths and size of your swap and consider adding a safer amount.
  - **Pool At Capacity:** There are temporary caps/limits to how much liquidity can be added to each pool. If you would like a pool's caps raised please signal your support on social media using the #OpenTheGates hashtag & $SPARTA & $BNB (or whatever token/pool you are referring to)
  - **Unlocks In ##:** This pool is less than 7 days old, you will have to wait until it fully initialises before you can move the liquidity to another pool.
  - **Confirm Lockup:** The pool you are entering was created less than 7 days ago; you need to confirm you realise your liquidity will be locked in this pool until the pool is at least 7 days old
- **I am having some other issue:** Reach out on Telegram to help narrow down the issue and get you back on track!
