## Swap Normal Tokens

Before you begin, make sure you have already created your wallet and connected it to the DApp. This guide assumes you have done the necessary steps to get setup including doing research on how these functions work. [We also have some extended information on 'swapping' here.](/swap.md)

#### 1. Swap page in the DApp

Visit the community DApp swap page: [https://dapp.spartanprotocol.org/swap](https://dapp.spartanprotocol.org/swap)

Or navigate to the swap page if you are already in the DApp:  
![Menu liquidity](/../../_media/guides/swap/nav-menu-swap.png)

- Open the menu
- Click 'Swap'

This can also be achieved via the 'pools' / 'home' page by clicking 'Swap' under the specific asset you want to swap:

#### 2. Select your asset to sell

- Select which asset you want to sell
- The purpose of this guide is for swapping *normal* tokens, not LP tokens, so we will be selecting the 'Tokens' tab to filter the choices down to only relevant tokens

![Select asset](/../../_media/guides/swap/select-asset.png)

---

#### 3. Select your asset to buy

- Select which asset you want to buy
- Again; the purpose of this guide is for swapping *normal* tokens, not LP tokens, so we will be selecting the 'Tokens' tab to filter the choices down to only relevant tokens

#### 4. Input an amount

- Input the amount of the token you would like to sell
- The estimated output amount of the other token will be calculated for you
- Remember that this is just an estimate; there is a max-slippage variable of 5% to revert the transaction if the output rate ends up being more than 5% worse than the estimated rate (this will be added to the DApp as a user-adjustable variable at some point)
- You may click the 'MAX' button next to your balance to use the full amount, but be careful of slippage (always check the rate to make sure you aren't doing a bad trade)
- If you are selling BNB; be conscious of leaving some BNB behind for gas in future txns

#### 5. Confirm Everything Before Continuing

- Confirm you have inputted and selected everything correctly
- You will see a 'Rate' row. This is the estimated swap rate that you are getting with this swap. You can click the 'arrows' to the right of this row to flip the rate over to the other token

![Confirm rate](/../../_media/guides/swap/confirm1.png)

- Below that is the 'Slip' row. This represents the percentage difference between the 'Spot' rate and the 'Swap' rate. One can consider this to be fairly comparable to the trading term: 'Spread' 

![Confirm slip](/../../_media/guides/swap/confirm2.png)

- Then we have the magical 'Revenue' row. This estimates the total revenue being generated by this transaction and being injected into the pool to be attributed directly to our liquidity providers

![Confirm revenue](/../../_media/guides/swap/confirm3.png)

- The last informational row is the 'Output' estimate. This is the amount that is estimated for you to receive

#### 6. First-Time Approval

- If this is the first time interacting with the relevant underlying contract (or if the contracts have been upgraded recently) you will need to perform some token approvals before performing the actual transaction
- Approvals/Allowance changing is a standard ERC20 (or BEP20 in this instance) token contract feature that helps prevent accidentally interacting with bogus contracts; you should always confirm the contract you are interacting with is the correct one in a DApp
- It involves a simple on-chain txn that allows your wallet to send a specific amount of a specific token to a specific contract. The contract in this instance is the Spartan Protocol ROUTER contract which handles the routing of funds from the user to the pools and back again
- Click approve and confirm each on your wallet once you have verified this is correct

#### 7. Perform Swap

- After approval, the button for the actual transaction should now be visible
- This is a good time to do a final check and verify all the inputs look correct
- Click the 'Sell' button and confirm the transaction in your wallet

![Add both txn](/../../_media/guides/swap/sell-button.png)

#### 8. Verify Result

- Congratulations! you just swapped between two assets in a decentralised fashion!
- Once the transaction completes, feel free to click the wallet icon (top right of DApp) and click the 'Tokens' tab to see your fresh tokens in your wallet

#### 9. Troubleshooting

- If after 'approval' the red button shows up but is disabled or has a different label, please see these reasons:
  - **Check Wallet:** You have not yet connected your wallet to the DApp.
  - **Check Input:** Your input amount is not valid; it might be 0 or a negative number. Confirm and fix.
  - **Check BNB (Gas):** You do not have enough BNB in your wallet to cover the chain gas costs of this txn. Transfer some BNB into your wallet to continue. Also confirm you have the intended wallet connected.
  - **Check Balance:** The input amount is higher than the balance in your wallet; go back and also confirm you have the intended wallet connected.
- **I am having some other issue:** No problem; reach out on Telegram to help narrow down the issue and get you back on track!
