## Wallets

Spartan Protocol is built ontop of BSC which is an EVM, meaning most common web3 tools from the Ethereum community are also compatible with the ecosystem by default.

#### Choose wallet

Choosing a wallet can be a bit subjective based on your preference and devices. If you already have a web3 wallet you use reguarly, it is advised to stick to what you already know. However if you are starting out fresh and need some guidance from these very first steps, the below should help you decide based on the device you use and other features that may be important to you.

##### Mobile wallets:

Mobile wallets are great for users who don't need the added security of a hardware wallet or maybe only use a hardware wallet for their cold storage. Mobile wallets tend to have great user interfaces and make things easy for the user. This usually comes at a cost of some features like testnet support & obviously hardware wallets.

##### Laptop / Desktop wallets:

The web3 experience tends to be best on larger devices, if you desire hardware wallet or testnet support, it is usually best to go for a desktop wallet via a chrome/brave browser extension.
